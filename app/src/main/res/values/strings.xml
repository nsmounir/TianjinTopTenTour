    <string name="news1">Straight off the bat, there are a couple of very important things to know. First up, drugs are very illegal in China. Don\'t do drugs here. Second, there has been a significant increase in drugs-related detentions and deportations for possession of, or testing positive for, drugs in China. Especially category B drugs such as marijuana.

We spoke with the UK government in China in the hope of making British people (and everyone else) aware of the possible consequences of casual drug use – be it a fine, administrative detention, deportation, travel ban and/or criminal charges – and what recourse is available to people who are detained.

Here are some fast facts that should be enough to put you off doing drugs from the outset:

Double the number of British people have been detained this year compared to same period in 2017.

The crackdown is not just focused on municipalities like Shanghai and Beijing, but in cities across China. Within eastern China, approximately half the British Consulate cases are split between Shanghai and the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

There has been an increasing number of deportations for possession of less than five grams of marijuana, with subsequent five-year travel bans imposed in most cases.

While the information in this article was provided to That\'s by the UK government, it is safe to assume the situation is similar for people of every nationality. So non-Brits, please consult your own embassy or consulate for the equivalent information that is offered to Brits here.</string>
